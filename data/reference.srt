1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
I spent 11 years in the U.S. Navy as a fighter pilot.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,720
For 18 years I flew fighters for the United States Navy.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,880
I spent 20 years working in the U.S. intelligence community.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,760
I served as the fourth director of national intelligence.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,080
I spent 25 years as a senior official with the CIA.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,840
I retired from the Navy as a one-star admiral after 32 years of service.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,960
I worked on highly classified UAP programs for the government as a senior scientist.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,200
I spent 32 years in and out of government in national security.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,400
I worked 28 years as an astrophysicist on highly classified UAP programs

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,280
for the United States government and for the defense industry.

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,680
I'm a professor in the Department of Pathology at Stanford University School of Medicine.

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,480
And for the last 10 years or so, I've been working with the Department of Defense

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,160
and people in the CIA on the UAP topic.

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,560
I've come to the conclusion that we are not only not alone in the universe,

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,080
but we have been discovered by an intelligence from some other part of the universe.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,600
There's evidence we are not alone.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,280
Humanity is not the only intelligent species in the universe.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,760
We're not alone in the universe.

19
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,960
It wouldn't be so arrogant to suggest there are no other forms of life out there.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,640
Humanity is not the only intelligence in the universe.

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,600
UAPs are real, they're here, and they're not human.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:24,920
There are other intelligences that have highly advanced craft interacting with the human population.

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,280
They are here, this is real, it's happening, it's happening now.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,880
Non-human intelligence exists, it's been interacting with humanity,

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,040
and it's been doing so on this planet for a long time.

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,280
We are not the only intelligent life form in the universe.

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,120
There's something here on the planet with us that is intelligent and more intelligent than us.

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,880
This is the biggest discovery in human history.

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:07,240
My name is Lou Elizondo.

30
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,520
In 2009, my life changed forever.

31
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,440
That's when I was recruited into a highly sensitive government program

32
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:21,800
that investigated unidentified aerial phenomenon, UAP, also commonly known as UFOs.

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,520
My work for the U.S. government goes back almost 30 years to when I joined the U.S. Army.

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,520
From there, I had the good fortune of being recruited into various programs within military intelligence.
